# Orange Belt Cryptography Module Progress

## Overview

The **Orange Belt Cryptography module** on [pwn.college](https://pwn.college){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} focuses on enhancing cryptographic skills through practical challenges. This module covers topics such as symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, and hashing algorithms, helping learners develop both theoretical and practical expertise in cryptography.

---

## Learning Objectives

Through this module, I aimed to achieve:
- A solid understanding of cryptographic principles.
- Hands-on experience with encryption and decryption.
- The ability to apply cryptographic techniques in problem-solving.

---

## Approach

### General Strategy
1. **Review Concepts**: Studied foundational topics in cryptography (e.g., AES, RSA, hashing).
2. **Break Down Challenges**: Simplified each problem into smaller, manageable tasks.
3. **Utilize Tools**: Employed cryptographic libraries and tools for encryption and decryption (e.g., Python’s `cryptography` library).
4. **Iterative Debugging**: Tested solutions incrementally to validate each step.

### Tools and Resources
- **Programming Languages**: Python and Bash.
- **Cryptographic Libraries**: OpenSSL, `cryptography`.
- **Learning Materials**: Module lectures, documentation, and online references.

## Reflections

### Key Insights
- **Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Encryption**: Grasped the practical applications of each approach.
- **Importance of Hashing**: Understood how hashing ensures data integrity and security.
- **Key Management**: Learned the critical role of secure key storage and handling.

### Challenges Faced
- **Complex Key Exchanges**: Decoding how public and private keys work together required deeper exploration.
- **Debugging Cryptographic Code**: Identifying issues in encryption/decryption logic was often tricky but rewarding.

## Update: Opening External Links in a New Tab

To enhance user experience, I’ve ensured that external links, such as [pwn.college](https://pwn.college){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, now open in a new tab. This prevents users from unintentionally navigating away from the current page. Here’s how I implemented it:

### Method
1. **Manual Markdown Syntax**:
   - For each external link, I added:
     ```markdown
     {:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
     ```
   - Example:
     ```markdown
     [pwn.college](https://pwn.college){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
     ```

2. **Optional Automation with Jekyll Plugin**:
   - Created a custom plugin (`_plugins/external_links.rb`) to automatically add these attributes to external links.
   - See my [guide on the implementation](#).

## Ethical Considerations

In line with the principles of academic integrity, this post avoids revealing specific solutions or challenge details. The purpose is to document my learning process without compromising the learning experience for others.

---

## Conclusion

Completing the Orange Belt Cryptography module has been a significant step in my cybersecurity journey. The module provided valuable insights into cryptographic concepts and equipped me with practical skills for tackling real-world problems.

---

## Next Steps

Looking ahead, I plan to:
- Dive deeper into advanced cryptographic techniques.
- Apply these skills in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions.
- Continue progressing through pwn.college modules.

For those considering this module, I highly recommend it as a hands-on way to learn cryptography in a controlled and engaging environment.
